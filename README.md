# Server Monitor
This tool uses NetData running on a machine to make a nice and easy display for a tablet

# How to use
You must first have NetData running over http, then just run the Dockerfile and go to the url.

**http://localhost:5173/?[server-one-name]=[server-1-ip]&[serer-two-name]=[server-two-ip]&[server-three-name]=[server-three-ip]**

There is no limit to how many servers you can have, just depends on how well your display scales.

# Notes
The code is pretty bad, however if it works it works and I don't care too much as I need this for prod like right now.
